Ok, this is my first AppleScript so do not expect any AS fanciness.

To get this script going, 

+ pull it down into your Applications folder
+ edit the_builds array to include record objects for the projects you want to watch
++ The get the id's, open the build you wish to watch and copy the value for buildTypeId on the querystring
+ edit the url in the CURL call to reflect your TeamCity's url
+ run the applescript
+ configure the application in growl to your liking


To Do ...
+ externalize the configuration
+ clicking growl notification links to teamcity
+ notify when somebody takes responsibility for failed build
+ renotification of failed build if not handled within x amount of time
+ show a building notification
